# Development Plan for rudu

#### 1. Code Quality and Maintenance
- Automated Testing: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all major functionalities using unit and integration tests. Expand tests to cover edge cases as well.
- Continuous Integration: Continue using GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines to automatically run tests, linters, and formatting checks upon each commit.
- Code Reviews: Implement a code review process for all pull requests to enhance code quality and knowledge sharing.

#### 2. Feature Enhancements
- JSON Output: Implement JSON export functionality (--format json) to complement existing CSV output, enhancing data interoperability.
- Size Filtering: Add a --min-size option to filter out files and directories below a specified size.
- Time-Based Filtering: Introduce options to filter entries by modification time, allowing users to focus on recent changes.
- Interactive Mode: Develop a TUI (Text User Interface) for an interactive exploration of directory structures, making use of the tui crate or similar.

#### 3. Performance Optimization
- Parallelization: Continue to refine multithreading strategies. Experiment with different rayon thread pool configurations for various hardware.
- Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to speed up subsequent scans of unchanged directory structures.
- Incremental Scanning: Investigate algorithms for efficiently scanning only changed portions of directories, reducing computation time.

#### 4. Documentation and Community
- Comprehensive Documentation: Ensure the README and additional docs are thorough, covering all features and offering examples for common use cases.
- Contribution Guidelines: Update contributing guidelines to simplify the onboarding process for new contributors.
- Community Engagement: Consider opening discussions or creating a Slack/Discord channel to facilitate community engagement and feedback.

#### 5. Future Exploration
- Cloud Integration: Research the feasibility of analyzing directories in cloud storage services directly, such as AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.
- Plugin System: Explore creating a plugin architecture for custom analyzers and formatters, allowing users to extend rudu as per their needs.
